# About

I'm Michael, a delivery engineer living and working in Wellington, NZ. I'm also a lover of anything to do with GNU/Linux and free and open source software.

My current obsessions are:
- Mechanical keyboards (small, ergonomic boards, in particular).
- E-ink displays and devices
- Coffee
- Automation

When not hunched over my computer at home, you can catch me hunched over my computer in a local cafe.
