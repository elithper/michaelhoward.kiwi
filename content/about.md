# About

I'm Michael, a technical product lead living in Te Awa Kairangi, Aotearoa NZ.
I'm also a lover of weird computers and anything to do with free and open
source software.

My current obsessions are:
- Mechanical keyboards (small, ergonomic boards, in particular)
- E-ink displays and devices
- Coffee
- TUIs and CLIs

When not hunched over my computer at home, you can catch me hunched over my
computer in a local cafe.
