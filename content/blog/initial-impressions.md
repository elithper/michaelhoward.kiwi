I recently made the somewhat frivolous decision to buy a pair of AirPods Max headphones. Frivolous, in that my decision was partly motivated by the fact you can customise them with an engraving.

The minimalist in me wanted something understated, like my initials. The anarchic hacker in me wanted a clever, nerdy joke. In the end, I compromised.

As you can see, instead of engraving a boring _MH_, I used the Unicode code points for the characters:
- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M `U+004D`
- LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H `U+0048`

I'm expecting this to be extremely useful if I ever lose my headphones at a Unicode Technical Committee meeting. Or a linguistics conference.
