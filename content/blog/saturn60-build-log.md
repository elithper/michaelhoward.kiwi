I've been building mechanical keyboards since 2020. And even though the number of weird and wonderful boards I've made is now in the double digits, I haven't documented the process very well.

So, for my latest build – the 70s-inspired Saturn60 – the I decided to take some nice pictures and timelapses along the way.

## Intro

I joined the group buy for the Saturn60 in October of 2020(!) and received it at the end of 2021. And if that wait wasn't long enough, I dithered for most of 2022 working out what switches and keycaps I wanted to use. Eventually I plucked up the courage to build the thing after Christmas. 

While I initially thought I would opt for a standard layout, I decided that nowadays I wouldn't get much use out of the board unless it was ortholinear. Fortunately, the Saturn60 also accommodates a [Boardwalk PCB](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/boardwalk/readme.md) and the runner of the group buy still had some matching plates in stock, well after the GB had finished.

## Assembly

Building the Saturn60 is straightforward for the most part, but with a couple of fiddly/infuriating steps along the way. Fortunately, there is an excellent [build guide](https://docs.acekeyboard.co/saturn-60-assembly-guide).

I started by mounting my switches[^2] onto their plate. Click to see the full timelapse in non-potato quality!

Following this, I soldered the switches to the PCB. As before, click for an equally boring, but much higher definition timelapse.

Next came the annoying part – sandwiching the plate/PCB in between the two halves of the case and screwing it all together. It sounds simple, but it's fiendishly easy for the plate/PCB to get slightly wonky during this step. Once misaligned, not only will your keys look slightly off,[^3] but you risk not having enough clearance between them and the case, causing some of the keys to scrape.

Still, it wasn't too bad in the end.

Until I realised I made a terrible mistake – I'd forgotten to attach the serial number plate on the back of the case. As you need access to both sides of the back case to attach this plate, I was forced to take the whole keyboard apart.

(No doubt you can feel the rage emanating from this photo.)

But I got done. Again.

## Keycaps

Adorning the assembled board is a set of SA SAIL keycaps. The set is based on a keyboard used in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in the early 70s. Everything about these keycaps is _perfect_. The colour, the mathematical symbols on the legends, the profile – everything.

For the past 18 months or so I've been trying to hunt down a set secondhand and finally lucked out. MyKeyboard.eu had some (new!) sets available and I couldn't resist.[^1] Honestly, I'm not even sure how they ended up with these in stock. Not that I'm complaining, of course.

## Closing thoughts

I had a blast building this keyboard and am really happy with the result. It may have taken a few years, but the outcome more than justifies the wait!
